The planning aims to deploy the workload of stimulation treatments with uncertain indicators. And the uncertainties of initial stimulation effect, annual effect error and new recoverable reserves are considered. With their uncertainty sets and the adaptability of decisions, a multiobjective multistage robust integer optimization model is constructed. In this model, the total development cost is minimized and the total new recoverable reserves is maximized. And the model makes decisions on the workload of each stimulation treatment in each year under constraints of annual oil production and workload balance. In addition, an algorithm for solving multiobjective multistage robust integer optimization model is proposed, which can obtain the finitely adaptive robust efficient solution set. Finally, a numerical example of long-term oilfield development planning is presented. The planning model with given uncertainty sets is solved, to verify the validity of the proposed model and algorithm.","tags":null,"title":"Supply chain network design under the risk of uncertain disruptions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sen Yan","Âê≥ÊÅ©ÈÅî"],"categories":["Demo","ÊïôÁ®ã"],"content":"import libr print(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;) Overview The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

The low frequency and non-repeatability of disruptive events also make it impossible to estimate the disruption probability accurately. Therefore, we construct an uncertain programming model to design the three-echelon supply chain network with the disruption risk, in which disruptions are considered as uncertain events. Under the constraint of satisfying customer demands, the model optimises the selection of retailers with uncertain disruptions and the assignment of customers and retailers, in order to minimise the expected total cost of network design. In addition, we simplify the proposed model by analysing its properties and further linearise the simplified model. A Lagrangian relaxation algorithm for the linearised model and a genetic algorithm for the simplified model are developed to solve medium-scale problems and large-scale problems, respectively. Finally, we illustrate the effectiveness of proposed models and algorithms through several numerical examples.","tags":null,"title":"Supply chain network design under the risk of uncertain disruptions","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Wowchemy is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience.

Supply chain network design plays an important strategic role in supply chain management and faces kinds of uncertainties, such as uncertain demand and cost. In order to deal with the impact of uncertain factors, this paper considers the supply chain network design under hybrid uncertainties, namely, the objective randomness of retailers‚Äô demand and the subjective uncertainties of operating costs. We construct three models to handle managers‚Äô different needs. They are the expected cost minimization model that minimizes the expected total cost, the $\\beta$-cost minimization model that minimizes the $\\beta$-cost which means that the chance measure of the actual cost not exceeding the cost is not less than the confidence level $\\beta$, and the chance measure maximization model that maximizes the chance measure of the actual cost not exceeding the given cost. This paper then transforms them into deterministic classes by uncertainty theory, and several numerical examples are presented to verify the validity of the models and algorithm.","tags":null,"title":"New models of supply chain network design by different decision criteria under hybrid uncertainties","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sen Yan","Xiaoyu Ji"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"25a5332a192f71157f596505a10aff7b","permalink":"https://syan-cn.github.io/publication/yan2018portfolio/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/yan2018portfolio/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper discusses the oil project optimal portfolio selection under uncertain environment where cash flows of the projects are mostly determined by experts‚Äô estimations due to the lack of historical investment data. The oil project investment is usually distinguished by its high input, high risk and highly fluctuating ROI sensitive to the economic, political and technology uncertainties. Besides, in most of the cases, it is quite difficult to find reliable referential historical data for a specific project. All these peculiarities make actual oil project investment decision under high uncertainties. In this paper, we use normal uncertain variables to describe the cash flows and estimate the uncertainty distribution of the cash flows by experts‚Äô experimental data. Then, under the constraint of controlling for bankruptcy, we give uncertain programming models to construct portfolios that maximize the expected returns and minimize the sine cross-entropy of the actual return from a prior return. Finally, we provide some numerical examples that fit different risk preference assumptions to further illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the models.","tags":null,"title":"Portfolio selection model of oil projects under uncertain environment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xiaoyu Ji","Sen Yan","Siyu Feng"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"7e832e085fdb27e5c160fbe4c9cedf6b","permalink":"https://syan-cn.github.io/publication/ji2017uncertain/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ji2017uncertain/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, we discuss the formulation of the oilfield development plan in case of significant nondeterminacy in oilfield development. And the plan needs to ensure production and achieve minimum cost and maximum new recoverable reserves. The uncertain factors in oilfield development are analyzed in this paper, and we consider the uncertain nature of the stimulation effect of measures and new recoverable reserves per well and quantify them. On this basis, an uncertain multi-objective optimal model of oilfield development planning is constructed. The model aims to minimize the expectation of development cost and maximize the expectation of new recoverable reserves, and optimizes the workload of each measure under the constraints including the oil production and the resources limitation. Based on uncertainty theory, the model is transformed into a deterministic model. And a nondominated sorting genetic algorithm with elite strategy is developed to solve the model and get the Pareto solution set. Then the multi-attribute decision-making is applied to select the multiple development plans, which provides the basis for the decision-making of the oilfield development plan. Finally, a numerical example is given to verify the effectiveness of the model and algorithm, and their practical application values under the background of oilfield development planning.","tags":null,"title":"Uncertain multi-objective optimal model of oilfield development planning and its algorithm","type":"publication"}]
