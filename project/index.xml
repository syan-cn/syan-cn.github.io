&lt;li>Engineered an efficient resource allocation system for Sinopec&amp;rsquo;s global natural gas resources by developing a multi-objective procurement and production optimization model, utilizing in-depth data analysis of resource characteristics, pipe network specifics, and demand patterns.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Enhanced an increase in profit by crafting a transportation optimization model, which strategically determined pipeline paths and volume, ensuring adherence to strict capacity and demand parameters.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Optimized a streamlined production planning process by analyzing practical requirements, which entailed defining decision variables, objectives, and constraints while also identifying potential uncertainties in the system.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Engineered a production execution plan by constructing a deterministic multi-objective model, utilizing the NSGA-II based algorithm to optimize production outcomes.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Enhanced the model&amp;rsquo;s predictive accuracy by transitioning to a stochastic framework, introducing productivity as a random component, and integrating the deterministic algorithm with Monte Carlo simulations to represent chance constraints.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Achieved a drastic reduction in algorithm running time, decreasing it from 1 week to a mere 3 hours, facilitating a swift annual production planning process and significantly boosting overall oil production efficiency.&lt;/li>
